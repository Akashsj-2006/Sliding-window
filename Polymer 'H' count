/*You will be given a String represent the polymer (polymer is a very large molecules, called macromolecules. Which are multiples of simpler chemical units called monomers.). Polymer contains only hydrogen and carbon. And given a number k represents the length of monomer. You can pick monomer in any manner but continuously. Find the monomer contains maximum number of hydrogens.

Input Format

first line contains strings s
second line contains monomer length k.
Constraints

String contains only Uppercase English letters.

K>0 && K< length of String.

Output Format

You must return the maximum number of hydrogens contains monomer.
